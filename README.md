# UST-D3CODE-Hackathon-24
What is hacking? Hacking is coming up with an amazing idea and working persistently on it. It is failing, failing again, and failing better. It is trying new things and learning in the process. It is working together, collaborating and building things that are innovative and forward-thinking. Finally, it is to be a better programmer.





This year, our theme, "Scale" takes center stage. Scale is the bedrock of modern innovation, and at D3, we’ll explore its profound impact - from transforming agile startups into global leaders, to broadening the reach of groundbreaking tech.

In this hackathon, we're seeking scalable solutions that create a positive social impact. In today’s rapidly changing world, the need for solutions that not only address immediate challenges but also create lasting, positive social impact has never been greater. Scalable solutions are key to this endeavor, as they have the potential to grow and adapt, reaching more people and making a broader impact over time. These solutions are to be designed with sustainability in mind, ensuring that as they expand, they continue to deliver benefits without depleting resources or causing harm to communities. By driving positive social impact, scalable solutions contribute to the well-being of society at large, addressing issues such as poverty, education, health, and environmental sustainability. They empower communities, foster inclusivity, and build resilience against future challenges. As we look to the future, the development and implementation of scalable solutions will be crucial in creating a more equitable and sustainable world, where positive change is not just possible but inevitable.
